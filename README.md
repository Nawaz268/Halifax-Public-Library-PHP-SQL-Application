# Halifax-Public-Library-PHP-SQL-Application

In this application, a team of four members from the MSCDA cohort of 2018 developed an application that improved upon the existing Halifax Public Library System. The application used technologies that included PHP for server side, SQL for database, and JavaScript and Python to migrate existing records into the new system. The project scored 100% on the grading criteria.
